# APRL GUI 
A frontend application for viewing engine telemetry and controlling engine systems, built in Qt 5.

## Building the GUI
Right now, the current setup is to convert the ```.ui``` file to a ```.py``` script via pyuic5, and adding custom code on top of that auto-generated script.
The final setup will include an ```.exe``` installer, but the ```.py``` file should be runnable if you have Python 3 installed.

### Dependencies
* Python 3
* PyQt5
* qtwidget
* PySerial (serial)
